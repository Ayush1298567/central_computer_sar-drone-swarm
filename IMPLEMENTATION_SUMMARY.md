- Root endpoint with API information (`/`)
- Static file mounting for uploads and static content
- Request logging middleware
- OpenAPI documentation endpoints

**Key Endpoints:**
- `GET /` - Root endpoint with API information

- `GET /api/v1/docs` - Swagger UI documentation
- `GET /api/v1/redoc` - ReDoc documentation

### 2. Logging System (`backend/app/utils/logging.py`)
âœ… **COMPLETED AND TESTED**

**Features Implemented:**
- `JSONFormatter` class for structured JSON logging
- `setup_logging()` function with file and console handlers
- `MissionLogger` class for context-aware logging
- Log rotation with configurable file size and backup count
- Specialized logging methods for SAR operations:
  - Mission start/end events
  - Drone status updates
  - Discovery events
  - Error events with context

**Configuration:**
- Configurable log levels
- File rotation (10MB max, 5 backups)
- JSON format for structured logging
- Console output for development

### 3. Geometric Utilities (`backend/app/utils/geometry.py`)
âœ… **COMPLETED AND TESTED**

**Features Implemented:**
- `Coordinate` dataclass for geographic coordinates
- `SearchGrid` dataclass for search area definitions
- `GeometryCalculator` class with comprehensive methods:

**Mathematical Algorithms:**
- **Haversine Distance Calculation**: Great circle distance between coordinates
- **Bearing Calculation**: Initial bearing from one point to another
- **Destination Calculation**: Calculate destination given start, bearing, and distance
- **Polygon Area Calculation**: Spherical area calculation using spherical excess method
- **Search Grid Generation**: Automatic grid generation with configurable spacing and overlap
- **Waypoint Calculation**: Generate intermediate waypoints along a path
- **Drone Path Optimization**: Assign search grids to drones based on distance and efficiency
- **Flight Time Calculation**: Estimate flight time based on path and drone speed
- **No-Fly Zone Checking**: Point-in-polygon testing for restricted areas

### 4. Configuration System (`backend/app/core/config.py`)
âœ… **COMPLETED AND TESTED**

**Features Implemented:**
- Pydantic-based settings with environment variable support
- Comprehensive configuration for all system components
- CORS origins configuration
- Database settings
- Logging configuration
- Mission-specific settings (max duration, max drones, etc.)
- Security settings
