### Emergency Response Hierarchy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  EMERGENCY RESPONSE LEVELS                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Level 1: KILL SWITCH (Most Aggressive)                     │
│  → Immediate motor disarm, drones fall                      │
│  → Use only when collision/injury risk > crash risk         │

## 🔧 Emergency Protocol Definitions

### 1. KILL SWITCH (`/api/v1/emergency/kill`)

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Imminent collision with people, aircraft, or structures
- Complete loss of control
- Fire or critical hardware failure
- Security breach requiring immediate shutdown

**Actions Taken:**
1. Immediately disarms all drone motors (MAVLink `MAV_CMD_COMPONENT_ARM_DISARM` with param1=0)
2. Drones will **fall from current altitude**
3. Broadcasts CRITICAL alert via WebSocket
4. Logs event to audit trail
5. Marks all missions as ABORTED

**Confirmation Required:** YES - Explicit `confirm: true` flag

**Timeout:** 2 seconds per drone

**Fallback:** If MAVLink emergency command fails, sends async disarm command

**Recovery:** Manual drone inspection required before re-arming

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Drone crash from current altitude
- **Mitigated By:** Only use when alternative is greater harm (collision, injury)
- **Acceptable Use:** Population evacuation, wildlife/aircraft conflict, catastrophic failure

---

### 2. EMERGENCY STOP (`/api/v1/emergency/stop-all`)

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Operator command for immediate halt
- Critical system error
- Weather emergency requiring immediate landing
- Manual override by safety officer

**Actions Taken:**
1. Sends `emergency_land` command to all connected drones
2. Drones perform controlled emergency landing at current position
3. Aborts all active missions (marks as ABORTED with reason)
4. Broadcasts emergency alert via WebSocket to all clients
5. Logs critical event with timestamp, operator ID, reason

**Confirmation Required:** NO - Immediate execution

**Timeout:** 5 seconds total for all drones

**Fallback:** Partial success allowed - reports which drones stopped vs failed

**Recovery:** Drones remain grounded until operator manually clears emergency

**Command Priority:** 3 (Highest)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Drones slow to hover
- Descend at safe rate (typically 1-2 m/s)
- Land and disarm motors
- Report landing complete via telemetry

---

### 3. RETURN TO LAUNCH (`/api/v1/emergency/rtl`)

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Low battery (< 20%)
- Communication degradation (signal < 30%)
- High winds or precipitation
- Mission time limit exceeded
- Operator command for organized return

**Actions Taken:**
1. Sends `return_home` command to all connected drones
2. Drones fly back to home position (launch coordinates)
3. Land at home position
4. Broadcast RTL alert via WebSocket
5. Log RTL event with reason

**Confirmation Required:** NO

**Timeout:** 3 seconds per drone

**Fallback:** Partial success allowed

**Command Priority:** 2 (High)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Drones calculate direct path to home
- Climb to safe return altitude if needed
- Fly direct route at cruise speed
- Descend and land at home
- Disarm motors after landing

---

### 4. EMERGENCY STATUS CHECK (`/api/v1/emergency/status`)

**Purpose:** Health check for emergency system

**Returns:**
- Emergency system operational status
- Number of drones connected
- Number of active missions
- Available emergency capabilities
- Timestamp

**Use Cases:**
- Pre-flight system validation
- Monitoring dashboard health display
- Automated health checks

## 🔒 Safety Semantics

### Command Execution Guarantees

1. **Atomicity:** Emergency commands execute completely or fail completely (no partial commands)
2. **Timeout Safety:** All commands have explicit timeouts to prevent indefinite blocking
3. **Idempotency:** Emergency commands can be safely retried without side effects
4. **Auditability:** All emergency actions logged with timestamp, operator, reason
5. **Fail-Safe:** System defaults to safest state on error (land, not hover)

### Priority System

```
Priority 3 (CRITICAL) → Emergency Stop, Kill Switch
Priority 2 (HIGH)     → Return to Launch
Priority 1 (NORMAL)   → Standard mission commands
Priority 0 (LOW)      → Telemetry requests, status checks
```

**Queue Behavior:** Higher priority commands preempt lower priority

### Error Handling Philosophy

1. **Graceful Degradation:** Partial success is acceptable (e.g., 8/10 drones stopped)
2. **Fail Loud:** All errors logged at CRITICAL level
3. **No Silent Failures:** Every error triggers alert/notification
4. **Operator Notification:** WebSocket broadcast ensures operator awareness
5. **Audit Trail:** Every action recorded for post-incident analysis

## 🚁 Drone Behavior Expectations

### Emergency Stop Behavior

**Expected Timeline:**
- T+0s: Command sent
- T+0.5s: Drone receives command
- T+1s: Drone begins emergency landing sequence
- T+2s: Drone descending at ~1-2 m/s
- T+10-30s: Drone lands (altitude dependent)
- T+31s: Motors disarmed

**Telemetry During Emergency:**
- Position updates every 1 second
- Altitude decreasing steadily
- Status changes: FLYING → LANDING → LANDED
- Battery level continues reporting

### RTL Behavior

**Expected Timeline:**
- T+0s: RTL command sent
- T+0.5s: Drone receives command
- T+1s: Drone calculates return path
- T+2s: Drone climbs to return altitude (if needed)
- T+5s-120s: Drone flies home (distance dependent)
- T+final: Drone lands at home and disarms

**Abort Conditions:**
- Battery critical (< 10%): Emergency land immediately
- Communication lost > 30s: Continue RTL on last known home position
- Obstacle detected: Attempt to avoid, may land if unavoidable

### Kill Switch Behavior

**Expected Timeline:**
- T+0s: Kill command sent
- T+0.5s: Drone receives disarm
- T+1s: Motors stop instantly
- T+1s onwards: **Drone falls** (no controlled descent)
- Impact: Altitude-dependent (h * ~0.45s per meter)

**Critical:** Kill switch causes **uncontrolled fall**. Only use when necessary.

## 🔬 Validation Procedures

### Unit Test Validation

```bash
# Run emergency system tests
pytest backend/tests/test_emergency_system.py -v --timeout=10

# Expected: 17+ tests pass, 0 failures
```

### Integration Test Validation

```bash
# Run with mock drones
pytest backend/tests/test_emergency_system.py::test_emergency_endpoint_integration -v

# Verify:
# - Emergency stop endpoint responds < 1s
# - WebSocket broadcast sent
# - Mission abortion triggered
```

### Hardware Test Validation (REQUIRES REAL DRONE)

```bash
# Connect to test drone via MAVLink
# WARNING: Drone will physically respond to commands

# Test 1: Emergency Stop
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/emergency/stop-all \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Hardware test", "operator_id": "test_pilot"}'

# Observe: Drone should land immediately

# Test 2: RTL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/emergency/rtl \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Hardware test", "operator_id": "test_pilot"}'

# Observe: Drone should fly home and land

# Test 3: Kill Switch (USE EXTREME CAUTION - DRONE WILL FALL)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/emergency/kill \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason": "Hardware test", "operator_id": "test_pilot", "confirm": true}'

# Observe: Motors stop immediately, drone falls
```

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Considerations

### Operator Responsibilities

1. **Duty of Care:** Operators must prioritize human safety above equipment
2. **Training Required:** All operators must complete emergency procedures training
3. **Judgment:** Operators authorized to trigger emergencies without supervisor approval
4. **Documentation:** All emergency activations must be documented
5. **Post-Incident:** Operators must participate in incident review

### System Limitations

1. **Communication Dependency:** Emergency commands require active drone connection
2. **Response Time:** Not instantaneous - allow 1-5 seconds for command execution
3. **Partial Success:** System may successfully stop some but not all drones
4. **Environmental Factors:** Wind, obstacles may prevent safe emergency landing
5. **Hardware Failures:** Motor or flight controller failures may prevent command execution

### Liability Considerations

- System provides **best-effort** emergency response
- No guarantee of 100% success rate in all conditions
- Operators assume risk when deploying system
- Regular testing and maintenance required to maintain safety
- Emergency procedures must be part of pre-flight briefing

---

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

### Incident Review Process

After every emergency activation:

1. **Immediate:** Download all logs (system + drone flight logs)
2. **Within 24h:** Conduct incident review meeting
3. **Within 48h:** Document findings and lessons learned
4. **Within 1 week:** Implement code/process improvements
5. **Within 2 weeks:** Re-test emergency procedures

### Metrics to Track

- Emergency activation frequency
- Success rate per emergency type
- Average response time
- Failure modes and root causes
- Operator feedback and suggestions
- Near-miss incidents (emergency almost triggered)

### Improvement Cycle

```
Monitor → Measure → Analyze → Improve → Test → Deploy → Monitor
```
