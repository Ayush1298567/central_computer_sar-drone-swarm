"""
Communication Package for SAR Drone System

Lightweight initializer: avoids importing protocol implementations at package
import time to prevent unnecessary heavy dependencies or side effects during
tests and simple utility imports.

Import required classes/functions directly from their submodules, e.g.:
    from backend.app.communication.drone_connection_hub import DroneConnectionHub
