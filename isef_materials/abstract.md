## Abstract

**Background:** Traditional search and rescue (SAR) operations face significant challenges in efficiency, coverage, and resource utilization. Current methods rely on grid-based search patterns that are often suboptimal for varying terrain and weather conditions, leading to delayed discoveries and increased risk to missing persons.

**Objective:** This study investigates the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) and genetic algorithm optimization in improving SAR drone swarm coordination, with the goal of maximizing search efficiency while minimizing time to discovery and energy consumption.

**Methods:** A comprehensive experimental framework was developed comparing three approaches: (1) traditional grid-based search patterns, (2) AI-optimized adaptive search patterns, and (3) genetic algorithm-evolved search patterns. The system was tested across 100 simulated SAR scenarios spanning five terrain types (mountain, forest, urban, water, desert) with varying weather conditions and urgency levels. Performance metrics included success rate, time to discovery, energy consumption, and coverage efficiency. Statistical analysis employed t-tests, effect size calculations (Cohen's d), and confidence interval estimation.

**Results:** The genetic algorithm approach demonstrated superior performance across all metrics. Compared to traditional methods, the genetic algorithm achieved a 35.4% improvement in success rate (0.883 ± 0.078 vs. 0.652 ± 0.147, p < 0.001), 37.8% reduction in time to discovery (28.3 ± 9.8 vs. 45.5 ± 14.7 minutes, p < 0.001), and 20.0% reduction in energy consumption (68.2 ± 5.9% vs. 85.3 ± 9.7%, p < 0.001). AI-optimized patterns showed intermediate improvements of 26.2% in success rate, 28.9% in time reduction, and 11.8% in energy savings. Effect sizes were large (Cohen's d > 0.8) for all significant comparisons, indicating practical significance.

**Conclusions:** This research demonstrates that AI-driven swarm intelligence can significantly enhance SAR operations through optimized search pattern generation and adaptive coordination. The genetic algorithm approach provides a novel framework for evolving optimal search strategies tailored to specific environmental conditions and mission requirements. These findings have immediate applications in emergency response systems and potential extensions to disaster relief, wildlife conservation, and security operations.

**Significance:** The demonstrated improvements translate to potentially life-saving reductions in search time and increased probability of successful rescue operations. The open-source nature of the developed algorithms enables global deployment and collaborative improvement of emergency response capabilities.
